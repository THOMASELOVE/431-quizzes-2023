# Sample Quiz: Five Old Quiz Questions

Dr. Love prepared a document containing five old quiz questions, as well as an answer sketch for those five questions, and some information on results. 

- Here is [the PDF document containing the old questions, answer sketch and results](five-old-quiz-questions.pdf).
- Here is [the mitral.csv data set](mitral.csv) referred to in Questions 2-4. It's also available on [our 431-data site](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).

This is for the benefit of students worried about Quiz 1 who wanted to understand what it might look like. It is a convenient sample of five old questions, and is **not** meant to be completely representative of what might be asked this year. We're not collecting responses on this set of questions, nor is it required that you even look at this document. If you have questions about this after reading the answer sketch at the end of the document, feel free to ask us.
