# 431-quizzes-2023

PQHS / CRSP / MPHP 431 Quiz Information for Fall 2023

During the semester, you will have two quizzes to complete. Each quiz is taken online via a Google Form (like the Minute Papers or the [Welcome to 431 survey](https://bit.ly/431-2023-welcome-survey).) Each quiz includes both short-answer and multiple-choice items. The quizzes focus on whether you can apply the tools developed in class to address small problems. As we approach the date for each of the two Quizzes planned for 431 this semester, more information will appear here.

## Deadlines

- The deadlines for each quiz are posted to the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/calendar.html).
- You will receive access to the quiz on the Thursday before it is due, and each quiz is designed to take about six hours to complete, so the time pressure should be minimal.
- **If you need to make alternate arrangements for a Quiz, please contact Professor Love via email as soon as possible**, at least a week before a Quiz is released. 

## Sample Quiz: Five Old Quiz Questions

Dr. Love prepared a document containing five old quiz questions, as well as an answer sketch for those five questions, and some information on results. [You'll find it all here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2023/tree/main/sample), if you are interested.

## General Information About the Quizzes

1. Quizzes typically involve 20-30 questions. 
2. The questions are not arranged in any particular order, and you should answer all questions.
3. All questions involve relatively short responses, sometimes after working through a detailed analysis.
4. You will have the opportunity to edit your responses after completing the Quiz, but this must be completed by the deadline.
5. You are welcome (even encouraged) to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are **not** allowed to discuss the questions on the Quizzes with anyone other than Professor Love or the teaching assistants.
6. We do not guarantee to answer questions we receive about the Quiz less than 3 hours prior to the Quiz submission deadline. As noted above, we will **not** use Campuswire for Quiz questions, but instead an alternate approach we will provide to you with each quiz.
7. Quizzes that are more than an hour late will **not** be accepted, except in truly remarkable circumstances.
8. An answer sketch for each Quiz will be made available within 48 hours of the deadline. 
9. Grades for the Quizzes are usually available within 48 hours of the deadline. 
10. If you feel Professor Love has made an error in grading your Quiz, please let him know directly, by email, as soon as possible.

## Grading the Quizzes

Each quiz will be graded solely by Professor Love. A detailed answer sketch and grading rubric will be provided to you when grades are available, usually within 48 hours of the quiz deadline. 

In calculating your quiz average for your course grade, Professor Love weights your stronger Quiz performance at 60% and your other Quiz at 40%.
