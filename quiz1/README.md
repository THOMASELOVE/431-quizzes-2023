## Fair materials for me to draw from in Quiz 1

- [Classes](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main) 1-12, including the Slides and the READMEs,
- our [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (all of Part A, and the little bit of Part B that is also covered in classes 1-12),
- Spiegelhalter's *Art of Statistics* through Chapter 6,
- [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) Sections 1-12, 
- [Labs](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) 1-3,
- our [Minute Papers](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-minute-2023) after classes 3, 5, 9 and 11,
- our [Favorite Movies work](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/movies) through Class 10, and
- the Data and Proposal parts of [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/).

This does not mean I will actually address all of these things in the Quiz.

## R Packages I can draw from in Quiz 1

Again, this doesn't mean I actually used all of these packages. It means that this list includes everything I did use in creating the Quiz and its answers.

- broom, Epi, ggrepel, glue, gt, gtExtras, Hmisc, janitor, mosaic, naniar, patchwork, simputation, xfun, and the tidyverse metapackage
- as well as the `Love-boost.R` script for the `bootdif()` function
