# Quiz 1 Materials

This page has links to all materials for Quiz 1.

## Instructions

Complete Instructions (including all of the questions for the Quiz) will be linked here on Thursday 2023-10-05 by 5 PM.

- Here is a [pdf **draft** of the General Instructions for Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2023/blob/main/quiz1/431-2023-quiz1-instructions-draft.pdf) (no questions, just the general instructions). We'll replace this document with the real instructions Thursday.

## Data

In our Shared Drive, in the Quiz 1 Materials folder (and the data subfolder within it), I have provided you with three data sets that are mentioned in the Quiz and which may be helpful to you, specifically:

- `sleep.csv`, which is first mentioned in Question 11
- `newborn.csv`, which is first mentioned in Question 13
- `algae.csv`, which is first mentioned in Question 16 

In addition, another Quiz question uses a specific data file (identified in the Instructions) from [our 431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/tree/main/data-and-code), and that file also has the potential to be useful to you.
 
## Google Form Answer Sheet

All of your answers should be placed in the Google Form Answer Sheet located at <http://bit.ly/431-2023-quiz1-form>. The form will open for submissions by 5 PM on Thursday 2023-10-05.

- All of your answers must be submitted through the Google Form by noon on Tuesday 2023-10-10, without exception.
- The form will close at 1 PM that Tuesday (to allow you up to one hour's leeway), and no extensions will be made available, so do not wait until the last minute on Tuesday to submit your work.
- We will only accept responses through the Google Form.

If you wish to work on some of the quiz and then return later, you can do this by:

1. completing the final question (the affirmation) which asks you to type in your full name, and then
2. submitting the quiz.

You will then receive a link at your CWRU email which will allow you to return to the quiz as often as you like without losing your progress.
  
## Fair materials for me to draw from in Quiz 1

- [Classes](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main) 1-12, including the Slides and the READMEs,
- our [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (all of Part A, and the little bit of Part B that is also covered in classes 1-12),
- Spiegelhalter's *Art of Statistics* through Chapter 6,
- [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) Sections 1-12, 
- [Labs](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2023) 1-3,
- our [Minute Papers](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-minute-2023) after classes 3, 5, 9 and 11,
- our [Favorite Movies work](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/movies) through Class 10, and
- the Data and Proposal parts of [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2023/).

This does not mean I will actually address all of these things in the Quiz.

## The 13 R Packages I might draw from in Quiz 1
